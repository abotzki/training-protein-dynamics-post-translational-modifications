    **Postdoctoral Researcher, Ghent University, BE** <br><br>
    He completed his master's degree in Bioinformatics at Saarland University, Germany, where he worked on detecting protein similarity in fast-evolving viral proteins using graph mining approaches. In 2016, he joined the CompOmics group and IB2 as a joint PhD student under the supervision of Prof. Lennart Martens (Ghent University) and Prof. Wim Vranken (Vrije Universiteit Brussel). His doctoral research focused on the FoldMod project, which aims to understand the role of local amino acid interactions in protein folding, fold stability, and the localization of post-translational modifications. He applies expertise in structural bioinformatics and proteomics informatics to study protein phosphorylation.
