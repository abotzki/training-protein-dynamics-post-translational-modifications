In this final chapter, we summarize the main steps and concepts covered throughout the training. The course combined biophysical predictions, sequence analysis, structural context, and post-translational modification data to explore a biologically relevant protein in a reproducible and practical way.

The workflow presented in this training is intended as a template that can be adapted to other proteins and research questions. Participants are encouraged to reuse and extend the presented approaches in their own projects.

## 6.1 Lessons learnt

Throughout this training, we highlighted several practical and conceptual lessons, including:

- How biophysical predictions complement both sequence and structural based analyses  
- The value of multiple sequence alignments for identifying conserved and variable regions  
- The importance of structural and biophysical context when interpreting PTMs  
- The benefits and limitations of prediction-based approaches  

These lessons aim to support more informed and critical use of computational tools in biological research.

## 6.2 Take-home messages

The key messages of this training can be summarized as follows:

- Biophysical profiles provide insight beyond primary sequence information  
- Integrating multiple data sources leads to more robust biological interpretation  
- Prediction tools are powerful but must be used with awareness of their assumptions  
- Reproducible workflows enable reuse and extension of analyses  

These points are intended to guide future analyses and encourage thoughtful tool usage.

## 6.3 Discussion and open questions

This section is intended as a space for reflection, discussion, and feedback.
