	Abstract = {Protein folding is a complex process that can lead to disease when it fails. Especially poorly understood are the very early stages of protein folding, which are likely defined by intrinsic local interactions between amino acids close to each other in the protein sequence. We here present EFoldMine, a method that predicts, from the primary amino acid sequence of a protein, which amino acids are likely involved in early folding events. The method is based on early folding data from hydrogen deuterium exchange (HDX) data from NMR pulsed labelling experiments, and uses backbone and sidechain dynamics as well as secondary structure propensities as features. The EFoldMine predictions give insights into the folding process, as illustrated by a qualitative comparison with independent experimental observations. Furthermore, on a quantitative proteome scale, the predicted early folding residues tend to become the residues that interact the most in the folded structure, and they are often residues that display evolutionary covariation. The connection of the EFoldMine predictions with both folding pathway data and the folded protein structure suggests that the initial statistical behavior of the protein chain with respect to local structure formation has a lasting effect on its subsequent states.},

    abstract = {Protein beta-aggregation is an important but poorly understood phenomena involved in diseases as well as in beneficial physiological processes. However, while this task has been investigated for over 50 years, very little is known about its mechanisms of action. Moreover, the identification of regions involved in aggregation is still an open problem and the state-of-the-art methods are often inadequate in real case applications.In this article we present AgMata, an unsupervised tool for the identification of such regions from amino acidic sequence based on a generalized definition of statistical potentials that includes biophysical information. The tool outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on two different benchmarks. As case-study, we applied our tool to human ataxin-3, a protein involved in Machado–Joseph disease. Interestingly, AgMata identifies aggregation-prone residues that share the very same structural environment. Additionally, it successfully predicts the outcome of in vitro mutagenesis experiments, identifying point mutations that lead to an alteration of the aggregation propensity of the wild-type ataxin-3.A python implementation of the tool is available at https://bitbucket.org/bio2byte/agmata.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

    abstract = {Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy data provides valuable information on the behaviour of proteins in solution. The primary data to determine when studying proteins are the per-atom NMR chemical shifts, which reflect the local environment of atoms and provide insights into amino acid residue dynamics and conformation. Within an amino acid residue, chemical shifts present multi-dimensional and complexly cross-correlated information, making them difficult to analyse. The ShiftCrypt method, based on neural network auto-encoder architecture, compresses the per-amino acid chemical shift information in a single, interpretable, amino acid-type independent value that reflects the biophysical state of a residue. We here present the ShiftCrypt web server, which makes the method readily available. The server accepts chemical shifts input files in the NMR Exchange Format (NEF) or NMR-STAR format, executes ShiftCrypt and visualises the results, which are also accessible via an API. It also enables the ”biophysically-based” pairwise alignment of two proteins based on their ShiftCrypt values. This approach uses Dynamic Time Warping and can optionally include their amino acid code information, and has applications in, for example, the alignment of disordered regions. The server uses a token-based system to ensure the anonymity of the users and results. The web server is available at www.bio2byte.be/shiftcrypt.},

    abstract = {Eukaryotic cells contain different membrane-delimited compartments, which are crucial for the biochemical reactions necessary to sustain cell life. Recent studies showed that cells can also trigger the formation of membraneless organelles composed by phase-separated proteins to respond to various stimuli. These condensates provide new ways to control the reactions and phase-separation proteins (PSPs) are thus revolutionizing how cellular organization is conceived. The small number of experimentally validated proteins, and the difficulty in discovering them, remain bottlenecks in PSPs research.Here we present PSPer, the first in-silico screening tool for prion-like RNA-binding PSPs. We show that it can prioritize PSPs among proteins containing similar RNA-binding domains, intrinsically disordered regions and prions. PSPer is thus suitable to screen proteomes, identifying the most likely PSPs for further experimental investigation. Moreover, its predictions are fully interpretable in the sense that it assigns specific functional regions to the predicted proteins, providing valuable information for experimental investigation of targeted mutations on these regions. Finally, we show that it can estimate the ability of artificially designed proteins to form condensates (r=−0.87), thus providing an in-silico screening tool for protein design experiments.PSPer is available at bio2byte.com/psp.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

abstract = {The role of intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDRs) in cellular processes has become increasingly evident over the last years. These IDRs continue to challenge structural biology experiments because they lack a well-defined conformation, and bioinformatics approaches that accurately delineate disordered protein regions remain essential for their identification and further investigation. Typically, these predictors use the protein amino acid sequence, without taking into account likely sequence-dependent emergent properties, such as protein backbone dynamics. Here we present DisoMine, a method that predicts protein’long disorder’ with recurrent neural networks from simple predictions of protein dynamics, secondary structure and early folding. The tool is fast and requires only a single sequence, making it applicable for large-scale screening, including poorly studied and orphan proteins. DisoMine is a top performer in its category and compares well to disorder prediction approaches using evolutionary information.

Here based on a carefully assembled data set derived from experimental data for proteins in solution, we quantify backbone dynamics properties on the amino-acid level and develop DynaMine--a fast, high-quality predictor of protein backbone dynamics. DynaMine uses only protein sequence information as input and shows great potential in distinguishing regions of different structural organization, such as folded domains, disordered linkers, molten globules and pre-structured binding motifs of different sizes. It also identifies disordered regions within proteins with an accuracy comparable to the most sophisticated existing predictors, without depending on prior disorder knowledge or three-dimensional structural information. DynaMine provides molecular biologists with an important new method that grasps the dynamical characteristics of any protein of interest, as we show here for human p53 and E1A from human adenovirus 5.},

The aim of our predictions is to identify the biophysical behaviour or features of proteins that are not readily captured by structural biology and/or molecular dynamics approaches. Upload of a FASTA file or text input of a sequence provides integrated predictions from DynaMine backbone and side-chain dynamics, conformational propensities, and derived EFoldMine early folding, DisoMine disorder, and Agmata β-sheet aggregation. These predictions, several of which were previously not available online, capture ‘emergent’ properties of proteins, i.e. the inherent biophysical propensities encoded in their sequence, rather than context-dependent behaviour (e.g. final folded state). In addition, upload of a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) in a variety of formats enables exploration of the biophysical variation observed in homologous proteins. The associated plots indicate the biophysical limits of functionally relevant protein behaviour, with unusual residues flagged by a Gaussian mixture model analysis. The prediction results are available as JSON or CSV files and directly accessible via an API. Online visualisation is available as interactive plots, with brief explanations and tutorial pages included.

	Abstract = {Protein phosphorylation is a key post-translational modification in many biological processes and is associated to human diseases such as cancer and metabolic disorders. The accurate identification, annotation, and functional analysis of phosphosites are therefore crucial to understand their various roles. Phosphosites are mainly analyzed through phosphoproteomics, which has led to increasing amounts of publicly available phosphoproteomics data. Several resources have been built around the resulting phosphosite information, but these are usually restricted to the protein sequence and basic site metadata. What is often missing from these resources, however, is context, including protein structure mapping, experimental provenance information, and biophysical predictions. We therefore developed Scop3P: a comprehensive database of human phosphosites within their full context. Scop3P integrates sequences (UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot), structures (PDB), and uniformly reprocessed phosphoproteomics data (PRIDE) to annotate all known human phosphosites. Furthermore, these sites are put into biophysical context by annotating each phosphoprotein with per-residue structural propensity, solvent accessibility, disordered probability, and early folding information. Scop3P, available at https://iomics.ugent.be/scop3p, presents a unique resource for visualization and analysis of phosphosites and for understanding of phosphosite structure-function relationships.},

	Abstract = {Proteins perform diverse functions critical to cellular processes. Transitions between functional states are often regulated by post-translational modifications (PTMs) such as phosphorylation, which dynamically influence protein structure, function, folding, and interactions. Dysregulation of PTMs can therefore contribute to diseases such as cancer and Alzheimer's. However, the structure-function relationship between proteins and their modifications remains poorly understood due to a lack of experimental structural data, the inherent diversity of PTMs, and the dynamic nature of proteins. Recent advances in deep learning, particularly AlphaFold, have transformed protein structure prediction with near-experimental accuracy. However, it remains unclear whether these models can effectively capture PTM-driven conformational changes, such as those induced by phosphorylation. Here, we systematically evaluated AlphaFold models (AF2, AF3-non phospho, and AF3-phospho) to assess their ability to predict phosphorylation-induced structural diversity. By analyzing experimentally derived conformational ensembles, we found that all models predominantly aligned with dominant structural states, often failing to capture phosphorylation-specific conformations. Despite its phosphorylation-aware design, AF3-phospho predictions provided only modest improvement over AF2 and AF3-non phospho predictions. Our findings highlight key challenges in modeling PTM-driven structural landscapes and underscore the need for more adaptable structure prediction frameworks capable of capturing modification-induced conformational variability.},
